/*Longest Consecutive Sequence
描述
Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.
For example, Given [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2], The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1,
2, 3, 4]. Return its length: 4.
Your algorithm should run in O(n) complexity.*/
